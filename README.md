# US Bond Yield Curve Visualisation App

## ✏️  About

I made a Tkinter app that generates an animation of the US Bond Yield curve over a specific period, taking data from the [US Government Treausry website](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve).
<br/>

## 🚀  Preparation
You need Python 3.0 or greater to run the script.

You also need the following libraries installed:<br/>
```
# Installing dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests beautifulsoup4 tkcalendar
```
<br/>

## 💻  Running the code
To run the app, you only need to execute `main_app.py`:<br/>
```
# To run the script
python main_app.py
```
Note that it will take around 10 seconds for the first run of each day as it needs time to access the latest daily data online. The app should launch quicker after the first run.
